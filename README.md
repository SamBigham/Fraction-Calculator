This is the ReadMe for Sam B's mini project 2 "Fun With Fractions"

Author: Sam Bigham
Date: September 17
Acknowledgments: I used stackoverflow to help me figure out how functions such as next(), and hasnext() work
Acknowledgments: Part of my BigFraction file was originaly from a lab my partner, Kevin F and
I did in class
 
 purpose: this program has two different files that can be run
 Interactive Calculator, which takes in inputs from the scanner,
 and then uses those inputs to do simple math on fractions.
 The fractions output can also be stored into any alphabetical letter.
 The second file is QuickCalculator which takes in arguments from the
 command line, and then it runs InteractiveCalculator using those command line arguments# Fraction-Calculator
